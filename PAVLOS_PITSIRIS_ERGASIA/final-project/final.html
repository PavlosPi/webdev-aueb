                    journey starts at 1972 when our Grandfather Pavlos Tsokkos created a restaurant at the
                    land that he used to grow orange trees as a farmer.  The restaurant was a big success
                    because people from all over the world experienced the Cyprus hospitality first handed
                    and tasted comfort homemade food prepared with love from our Grandmother Chrystalleni
                    Tsokkou. As the tourism rapidly increased the next years, the decision to build a hotel
                    was a natural one.  Science then Pavlo Napa strives to provide to our quests a quality
                    tourism experience driven by the pure values our ancestor gave us.
