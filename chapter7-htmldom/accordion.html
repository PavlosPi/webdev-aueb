                The students will be introduced to the R programming language, a programming language that
                was specifically developed for analyzing data, and is today widely used in most organizations
                that conduct data analysis. The students will learn how to explore datasets in R, using
                basic visualization tools and summary statistics, how to run different kinds of regressions
                and analyses, and how to perform statistical inference in practice, for example how to
                test certain hypotheses regarding the data or how to compute confidence intervals for
                quantities of interest. The students will also learn how to use R in order to conduct
                simulations, an extremely useful tool that can fulfill a wide range of analytical tasks.
                Simulation techniques covered will include Monte Carlo, importance sampling and rejection
                sampling. Finally, the students will learn how to estimate the precision of computed
                sample statistics using resampling methods. The course uses a hands-on approach,
                with nearly half the work done in the lab.

                Students will acquire the knowledge to conduct statistical analysis on a variety
                of data sets using a wide range of modern computerized methods. The students
                will learn how to recognize which tools are needed to analyze different types
                of datasets, how to apply these tools in each case, and how to employ
                diagnostics to assess the quality of their results. They will learn about
                statistical models, their complexity and their relative benefits depending
                on the available data. Some of the tools that will be discuussed include
                linear simple and multiple regression, nearest neighbors methods,
                shrinkage methods (ridge, lasso), dimension reduction methods 
                (principal components), logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis,
                tree-based methods, model selection algorithms and clustering. 
                The focus of the course will be less on theory and more on providing
                the students with as much intuition as possible and acquainting them 
                with as many methods as possible. The course will make substantial use 
                of the R statistical programming language and its libraries.
